  <h1>My Top Travel Destinations</h1>
  <p>I <em> absolutely love </em> to travel! I took my first plane ride when I was <strong>5 years old </strong> and before I reached 12 I was jetsetting solo for trips to see family across the country. It may have inspired a bit of a travel bug in me because from a young age I have always had the desire to see and experience the different sights and cultures around the world.</p>

    <h2>The Places I"ve Been & My Travel To-Dos</h2>
    <p>I haven't done much extra-continental travel, unfortunately. My first experience abroad was in 2018 going to Tanzania, Africa. It was an amazing trip that gave me a lot of perspective over travel and life in general.</p>
    <p>My Travel To-Dos include: (1) eat the local food, or at the very least try it; (2) stay vigilant and plan ahead, if walking study your route before you leave because you never know when you might lose service; (3) adding to that point, write down numbers and save contacts, be safe but don't be afraid to befriend locals. They may be able to help in a crunch or introduce you to some really cool spots and are typically some of the coolest people you'll ever meet.</p>
